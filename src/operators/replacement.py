    new individuals directly replace the worst individuals in the population
    regardless of whether or not the new individuals are fitter than those
    they replace. Note that traditional GP crossover generates only 1 child,
    whereas linear GE crossover (and thus all crossover functions used in
    PonyGE) generates 2 children from 2 parents. Thus, we use a deletion
